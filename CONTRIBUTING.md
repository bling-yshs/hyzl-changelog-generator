Right now, I think the action is fairly feature complete. There are always more special cases that could be covered. This action was started as an simple changlelog. There are other more complex actions out there.

I'm happy to take a look if you've got a feature you'd let to add. Please don't be offended if it doesn't make it in. Its awesome to see all the interest in the action.

If you've found a bug submit an issue and PR and we will get it sorted.

Thanks!
